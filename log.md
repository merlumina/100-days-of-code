# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Exercises 21-26 in Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I maybe should have worked through LRtHW before starting my program at Flatiron, as honestly most of what I've worked through is extremely basic and given my previous exposure to intro-to-coding courses, I have it all pretty much ingrained in my brain at this point. Nevertheless, I'm going to keep going through it as a supplement while in between coursework, as I've found every intro course approaches things a little differently so there's always a few nuggets to pick up here and there.
