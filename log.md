# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Exercises 21-26 in Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** I maybe should have worked through LRtHW before starting my program at Flatiron, as honestly most of what I've worked through is extremely basic and given my previous exposure to intro-to-coding courses, I have it all pretty much ingrained in my brain at this point. Nevertheless, I'm going to keep going through it as a supplement while in between coursework, as I've found every intro course approaches things a little differently so there's always a few nuggets to pick up here and there.

### Day 1: January 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I worked through Exercise 31 in Learn Ruby the Hard Way and read The Odin Project articles on enumerable methods and debugging.

**Thoughts** I'm starting to close the gap between my progress through these intro lessons and my current knowledge through Flatiron's curriculum. Pretty soon I should be all caught up! Since class is starting up again soon, it will be nice to be in a place where I can reference the same topics from these other sources as a way to get a different perspective and strengthen my understanding.
